This is my0x05-pointers\_arrays\_strings project
Task 0: function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
Task 1: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers
Task 2: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Task 4: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
Task 5: Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
Task 6: Write a function that reverses a string.
Task 7: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line
Task 8: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
      Prototype: void puts\_half(char *str);
      The function should print the second half of the string
      If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, 
             where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
Task 9: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
Task 10: Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), 
          to the buffer pointed to by dest
Task 11: Write a function that convert a string to an integer
Task 12: Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
